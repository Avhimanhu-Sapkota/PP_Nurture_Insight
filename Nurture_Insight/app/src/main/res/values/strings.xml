    <string name="cdi1_message1">Take a Breath!</string>
    <string name="cdi1_message2">Focus on your breathing to slow down the adrenaline response and the distressing thoughts.
        \nBreathe mindfully and notice the sensations of breathing into your belly. You might find it helpful to count your breaths, or to
        breath in to a count of 4, and out to a count of 4.
        \n\nSwipe to continue.
    </string>

    <string name="cdi2_message1">Observe!</string>
    <string name="cdi2_message2">Your thoughts and feelings.
        \nFor Example:\n  - I\'m anxious.\n  - My body\'s alarm system has been triggered.\n  - My mind is tricking me into believing I\'m in danger
        \n  - I\'m feeling really tense and hyped up.
        \n\nSwipe to continue.
    </string>

    <string name="cdi3_message1">Pull Back!</string>
    <string name="cdi3_message2">Ask Yourself:
        \n  - Is this really true or does it just feel that way?
        \n  - Is this fact or opinion?
        \n  - What would a friend say about this?
        \n  - What advice would I tell someone else?
        \nEven though it feels really bad, these physical sensations are a normal body response…it will pass.
        \n\nSwipe to continue.
    </string>

    <string name="cdi4_message1">Your Turn!</string>
    <string name="cdi4_message2">Now it\'s over to you. Don\'t worry though, this part is easy. Try something that works for you. Maybe do something that helps you
        relax, read through some positive quotes or affirmations, do some deep breathing exercises, or remind yourself that you are in the present.
        \nThere is no right or wrong thing to try, whatever works for you is best!
    </string>

    <string name="bci1_message1">Belly Breathing!</string>
    <string name="bci1_message2">
        Belly breathing is easy to do and very relaxing. Try this basic exercise anything you need to relax or relieve stress.
        \n\n  - Sit or lie flat in a comfortable position.
        \n\n  - Put one hand on your belly just below your ribs and the other hand on your chest
        \n\n  - Take a deep breath in through your nose, and let your belly push you hand out. Your chest should not move.
        \n\n  - Breathe out through pursed lips as if you were whistling. Feel the hand on your belly go in, and use it to push all the air out.
        \n\nDo this breathing 3 to 10 times. Take your time with each breath.
        \n\nWell done! Keep practicing this technique or swipe right to try out a new one if your are not feeling any better.
    </string>

    <string name="bci2_message1">4-7-8 Breathing!</string>
    <string name="bci2_message2">
        This exercise also uses belly breathing to help you relax. You can do this exercise either sitting or lying down.
        \n\n  - To start, put one hand on your belly and the other on you chest as in the belly breathing exercise.
        \n\n  - Take a deep, slow breath from you belly, and silently count to 4 as you breathe in.
        \n\n  - Hold your breath, and silently count from 1 to 7.
        \n\n  - Breathe out completely as you silently count from 1 to 8. Try to get all the air out of your lungs by the time you count to 8.
        \n\nRepeat this breathing exercise 3 to 7 times or until you feel calm.
        \n\nWell done! Keep practicing this technique or swipe right to try out a new one if your are not feeling any better.
    </string>

    <string name="bci3_message1">Roll Breathing!</string>
    <string name="bci3_message2">
        Roll breathing helps you to develop full use of your lungs and to focus on the rhythm of your breathing. You can do it in any position.
        But while you are learning, it is best to lie on you back with your knees bent.
        \nPractice roll breathing daily for several weeks until you can do it almost anywhere. You can use it as an instant relaxation tool anytime you need one.
        \nCaution: Some people get dizzy the first few times they try roll breathing. If you begin to breathe too fast or feel lightheaded, slow your breathing. Get up slowly.
        \n\n  - Put your left hand on you belly and your right hand on your chest. Notice how hands move as you breathe in and out.
        \n\n  - Practice filling your lower lungs by breathing so that your \'belly\' (left) hand goes up when you inhale and your \'chest\' (right) hand remains still.
                Always breathe in through you nose  and breathe out through your mouth. Do this 8 to 10 times.
        \n\n  - When you have filled and emptied your lower lungs 8 to 10 times, add the second step to your breathing: inhale first into your lower lungs as before,
        and then continue inhaling into your upper chest. Breathe slowly and regularly. As you do so, your right hand will rise and your left hand will fall a little
        as you belly falls.
        \n\n  - As you exhale slowly through your mouth, make a quiet, whooshing sound as first your left hand and then your right hand fall. As you exhale, feel the
        tension leaving your body as you become more and more relaxed.
        \n\n  - Practice breathing in and out in this way for 3 to 5 minutes. Notice that the movement of your belly and chest rises and falls like the motion of rolling waves.
        \n\nWell done! Keep practicing this technique or try out a new one if your are not feeling any better.

        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"
